# TODO

* Shorten sample files from [UIowa](http://theremin.music.uiowa.edu/MISpiano.html)
* Add CLI UI for easy/medium/hard mode
* Clean up code / improve "idiomatic-ness"

# Notes

* why did I have to `go get` `beep`'s dependencies?

```
$ go get github.com/hajimehoshi/go-mp3
$ go get github.com/hajimehoshi/oto
$ go get github.com/pkg/errors
```
